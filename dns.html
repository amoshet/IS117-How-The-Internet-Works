            <h1>DNS</h1>
            <p>
                The Domain Name System, commonly referred to as DNS. The DNS correlates names of a website such as, ‘www.google.com’, with their addresses and our systems are programmed to search for designated domain names and get the required IP address for the webpage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The only way we successfully visit our favorite websites so easily is not as straight forward as the face value of what we type, in fact our browsers need to know the IP address of the website being accessed. For web surfing to happen successfully, our browsers send a request to the DNS as a site URL (Uniform Resource Locater) and eventually over to an IP address.
            </p>

            <p><br>
                Initially, a DNS request collaborates with a Recursive Name Server which is generally hosted by our Internet Service Providers (ISP). However, if your browser search for a specific website is not met with the RNS, the search will re-route to one of thirteen, ‘route servers’. It may seem like a small number of servers for the billions of webpages online, but an infrastructure is in place for redundant physical hardware to handle the full load. The IP address desired is received within the DNS routers and sent back in the direction from where the search was initiated, and the webpage is finally displayed on our screens.
            </p>
            <p>
            A key takeaway is now that our systems have memorized the IP address for the websites successfully visited, the Recursive Name Server has now stored this information with the help of a process called, Cache for future accessibility. There are various scenarios in this technically inclined process that can go wrong, and therefore a recourse plan should always be implemented. For example, if a webpage changes IP, addresses problems can arise especially if our PC is trying to use its own Cache as a reference point. We can all attest to experiencing a 404 error in these possible situations but with the immense amount of work arounds in today’s era, DNS has made the internet extremely user friendly.
