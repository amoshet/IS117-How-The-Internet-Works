      <h1>IP Addresses, Packets, and Routing</h1>
	<p>
	  In the early 1970s, Vint Cerf, father of the internet, began working on the design of what is now called the internet. He was given the responsibility and opportunity to design the internets protocols and its architecture. The immense amount of data and information roaming around the internet is extraordinary. The question is, how is all the data over the internet delivered to us so reliably. It is not as simple as direct dedicated connections that are hard wired into each component as it would be impossible to keep things working. Nonetheless, data makes it way around on the internet in a completely unexpected method.

	  Communication protocols on the internet go from one computer to another in what is called, a packet of information. A packet travels from one place to another on the internet by adjusting according to online traffic congestion. All kinds of digital information can be sent with IP packets but there are some limits. Each packet has the internet address of where it is coming from and where it is going. This is where the utilization of routers comes in, these devices act as traffic controllers to keep the packets moving around the networks seamlessly.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	  As part of the internet protocol, each router keeps close attention to the multiple paths for sending packets and chooses the destination based on IP address availability. In most cases, the best route for data travel is never the simpler and most straight-forward route. This is why these paths are constructed in a fault tolerant method which is the foundational principle of internet reliability.
