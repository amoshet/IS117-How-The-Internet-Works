      <h1>Domain Names and ICANN</h1>
	<p>
	  What are Domain Names? As of 2019, there are over 2 Billion domain names on the internet. You may be wondering who tracks and a manages all this data? Let us start at the top, with the Internet Corporation for assigned Names and Numbers or (ICANN) for short is a non-profit that is responsible for a lot of the functions that keep the internet running smoothly. This includes managing and coordinating IP addresses, domain names, and DNS. ICANN is also responsible for crediting registrars like, Go Daddy. Registrars are independent companies that allow the public to purchase and register domain names. When purchasing a domain name, it must also be registered with ICANN, they require registrars to collect purchase information including, name, address, and email. This information is also referred to as WHOIS data.

	<p><br>
	  As a governing body ICANNs goal is to provide accurate and timely access to WHOIS data, to accomplish this there are licensed registrars that work within ICANN. A random fun fact, WHOIS is not an acronym for anything, it is just simply in search for personal and relevant data. It is important to know that WHOIS is not a single centrally operated database, it is a term used to describe all the purchaser information collected and managed which they then make available to the public. Anyone can use a WHOIS lookup to search for the owner of a domain name, assuming it is not privately registered. In addition, ICANN periodically assesses the effectiveness of WHOIS to determine whether it meets the legitimate need of law enforcement.
